  <a href="parser.html">This tool</a> is a client-side <strong>only</strong> parser for CyberNations
  log files. <br/>

  The tool parses the provided log files to determine a combination of war and aid information. It
  then leverages this information and organizes it to determine what nations have open aid slots to
  send and/or receive aid based on the strength threshold specified. It is assume that any nation
  above a given threshold will be able to send aid, while nations below it are only meant to receive
  aid.

  <h4>Base Functionality</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>User specifies an alliance of interest to analyze (default: Freehold of the Wolves)</li>
    <li>User specifies a strength threshold to use to split nations between senders of aid and
      receivers of aid (default: 80k)
    </li>
    <li>
      User uploads CyberNations_SE_Nation_Stats.txt, CyberNations_SE_War_Stats.txt,
      CyberNations_SE_Aid_Stats.txt. These files can be downloaded from <a
        href="https://www.cybernations.net/stats_downloads.asp">https://www.cybernations.net/stats_downloads.asp</a>
    </li>
    <li>The tool parses the data and presents a table of all active (non-pending) nations in the
      alliance, some summary statistics, and several lists of nations, e.g. those at war who can
      receive aid and those rulers who have aid slots open to send aid.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Advanced Functionality</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      User can provide the following files to specify nation IDs to target for specific aid
      campaigns.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>non-war-aid.txt</strong> - a list of nation IDs to target for non-war purposes
        </li>
        <li><strong>war-aid.txt</strong> - a list of nation IDs to target for preferred war aid</li>
        <li><strong>invalid.txt</strong> - a list of nation IDs to preclude from receiving aid, e.g.
          one might be on this list if they used received aid irresponsibly
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Each file takes a list of nation IDs, one per line. Anything in these files following //
      will be treated as a comment and not processed.
    </li>
    <li>Example of how to format the data files:
      <pre>
        // this is a comment
        8000 // this is a nation ID with a comment
        1000
        15232 // RulerName, this nation needs an MP
      </pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Other Notes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Known to work on Chrome, Edge. Firefox fails due to some CSP issues.</li>
    <li>
      Once the data is loaded, you can change the alliance of interest or the aid strength threshold
      and hit the
      <emph>Refresh</emph>
      button to reload the table. You can click the table's headers to sort the data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Change aid strength threshold to select who is supposed to give and who is supposed to
      receive aid. Note that that the CN Log data does not include improvements or wonders
      for nations, so this threshold is also used as lever to determine who has 6 vs 5 aid slots.
      A custom set of data would be required to account for this.
    </li>
  </ul>
